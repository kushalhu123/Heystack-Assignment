1,"May 13, 2021","I am so happy, finally, the general public has the ability to purchase cleaning products again. It was so difficult to buy them. The wipes are easy to take out. I used it for clean kids toys, doors, TV tables, counter tops in kitchen and bathrooms. Bonus point: kills COVID-19 VIRUS!",5.0,Value for money,WalmartCustomer
2,"December 23, 2020","Love these! They last long in our vehicles even in the summer heat. To help prevent drying out and from them leaking since they have a lot of liquid in them, I place the container in a zip lock bag. They are thick. They do not tear easily, and I like the fabric type texture.",5.0,NO TITLE BY USER,Jessica
3,"April 10, 2021",Product is great! only issue was either the packaging or delivery service since I ordered 2 packs one of them came soaked not sure If it open and spilled all over or of there was a hole.,4.0,Great Product!,Yoshira
4,"December 27, 2020",All three containers leaked in transit. I use to use the 24/7 pre COVID. Now it is so hard to get them. They said I could refund or replace. I asked for replacement now they are out of stock.,3.0,Not really fit for shipping.,TampaDeb
5,"December 21, 2020",I don't know why walmart keeps sending disinfectant any wipes that have clearly been opened. I had ordered baby ganics wipes awhile back and had to return them. I can't trust that they haven't been used or tampered with if they arrive open. there is no foil seal on the inside.,1.0,Be Careful,Nadia

14,"February 8, 2021","Excellent product if you're lucky to find it. Mom has been using it to wipe my paws after our walk and has worked great to kill germs I may pick up.

15,"June 23, 2021","I love the product, but upon latest delivery there was no 'juice' in the bottom of the container - for all of them. The wrappers were all wet and so had to remove them all. For now the first container is fine, but I'm guessing it will dry up before we use them up. Disappointed",3.0,puzzled,northwoods50

17,"April 7, 2021","I just received this order delivery today and I have to tell you that Im so disappointed with regard to the packaging. The box was wet on one side and I could smell the strong contents of the Clorox disinfecting wipes coming from the inside! I had not opened the box at that point but the smell was so strong so you can imagine once I did open the contents! Paper was inserted into the box but there was no other type of wrapping other than what the item came with. The contents was soaked and two of the containers lids were slightly opened! Liquid was all over, it was a huge mess!! Needless to say I will not be ordering this item from Walmart in the future! With COVID-19 in effect and being handicapped I thought ordering any product would be safe not to mention convenient, but little did I know I was wrong!! I have ordered laundry soap liquid as well as other types of liquids and have not experienced this issue! Not happy with this at all. Im hoping that when I do use the item there will be liquid left inside that keeps the wipes moist!",1.0,Poor packaging for the Clorox disinfecting wipes,Diana
18,"May 8, 2021","My family and I have been using these Clorox disinfecting wipes for years. We trust Clorox to protect us against bacteria, germs and viruses. We use these in every part of our home. Door knobs, the bathroom, the kitchen and even wiping down the kids toys. Leaves everything clean and smelling nice. The lemon scent is my absolute favorite. Makes the whole area smell like you've spent a hours cleaning. Works great on the stove too. Easily breaks down and wipes up grease and other touch splatters and spills like tomato sauce. We've really counted on these the last two years to keep us safe and I am happy to report we have stayed safe and haven't been sick the entire two years. For that, I am very thankful to Clorox.",5.0,Great For Your Family,Nelle
19,"May 17, 2021",I have been using these for YEARS prior to this Pandemic. I used to by them in the 3 pack at a Wholesale store. But the inability to obtain over the past year was frustrating. I am so glad I can now get these to wipe down all surfaces in bath and kitchen with the safe feeling I get from using Clorox products .,5.0,"Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, (225 Count Value Pack),",Lindugas

22,"April 10, 2021","Name brand that has been known in the cleaning industry for years. These wipes are a good size, and come out of the container without rubbing or tearing on a rough plastic like the less expensive brands. They are easily torn apart on taking out of the container, where as some other brands many cloths are wasted because 3-5 come out at once. There is a nice, refreshing scent without being too harsh and abrasive. Also, the individual cloths are moist so you know you are getting some cleaner with them. Most other brands come out dry. I've even had to pour more cleaner in half used containers of other brands directly over the cloths because they were dried out. Waste of money. During this time of Covid we have depended on these and had a container in almost every room, as well as the car. We simply trust them. And, will continue to have available in our home long after we get back to ""normal"".",5.0,Refreshing and trustworthy,TRP
23,"April 22, 2021","These Clorox disinfecting wipes are great. I just love them and due to the Pandemic, they are very hard to find.

32,"March 29, 2021","As we all know, during COVID-19, everything Clorox disappeared. Now that I'm able to re-purchase, I bought a three pack of these to have on hand.
